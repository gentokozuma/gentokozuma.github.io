Hello and thank you for your interest in my blogs. Currently, I have two blogs and a YouTube page: [newspalette](http://gentokozuma.github.io/newspalette/), [Americano Red](http://americanored.tumblr.com/), and [GK Translation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9KzXZv3YHhV_wkXb9UFsFg).

[newspalette](http://gentokozuma.github.io/newspalette/) is a blog updated daily with popular news topics. These news topics are summarized for easy consumption and assorted with terrible drawings that I try to get creative with to get my point across. e.g.

[Americano Red](http://americanored.tumblr.com/) is a tumblr blog. I try to post well educated memes, funny gifs, and beautiful artwork.

[GK Translation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9KzXZv3YHhV_wkXb9UFsFg) is a YouTube channel for motivated English speakers learning Japanese. The channel features English subtitles of Boku No Natsuyasumi (My Summer Vacation) gameplay.
